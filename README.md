# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Implementation

This repository demonstrates an implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a fundamental technique for dimensionality reduction in data science and machine learning.

## Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised learning algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of data while retaining most of its variation. It's particularly useful for visualizing high-dimensional data and as a preprocessing step for machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- Implementation of PCA from scratch using NumPy
- Visualization of results using Matplotlib
- Example usage with sample datasets

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for comparison and sample datasets)
